# java_resume_builder
finding a way to make a resume PDF from json which is able to be parsed by tools like https://resume-parser.vercel.app/

currently just a sample website created using: https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-form-submission/

# PDF generation
starting to follow this guide: https://www.baeldung.com/java-pdf-creation
added the dependencies and nothing else yet

# File download capability
added code from: https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-file-download to be able to download a pdf stored in the repo at http://localhost:8080/download/file/Ryan_Lewis_July_Resume.pdf

# website integration
Need to add a button on the site that triggers the pdf generation
